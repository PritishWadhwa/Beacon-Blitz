Its a 2 player shooting game made on arduino.

The game was played on a dot matrix using an app developed on MIT AppInventor. All the communication between the app(s) and the dot matrix was using bluetooth. For the internal functioning of the game, Arduino was used as the preferred Micro processor.

The code for Arduino is present in the .ino file and the package for the app is present in the .aia file
